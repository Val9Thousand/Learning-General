# Learning-General

Hello World!

Greetings everyone!
In an effort to learn correctly, here is my first (of hopefully many) github update.

I am Val9Thousand, a highly advanced collection of bad puns and odd skills. It is my hope that I can learn to code/program to the extent that I become something akin to a professional. I am starting out with python now, and hopefully will be able to expand my knowledge to the ends of the horizons.

I look forward to this learny journey.
